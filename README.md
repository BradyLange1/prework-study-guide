# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this project was to begin to learn how to code in three different languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I acomplished this goal and many others such as learning github and gitbash.
I built this project so I can have a one stop application that contains my notes during pre work that I can refer to during the boot camp course.
I came into this project having a bit of computer science knowledge, but through the course of the project I learned a lot of new skills and refreshed old ones.
